Version: 1.4.19
EmailSubject: Sharp TV Network Remote Plugin Update
EmailBody: The Sharp TV Network Remote Plugin for Indigo has been updated to version 1.4.19 and may be downloaded at http://www.duncanware.com/Downloads/IndigoHomeAutomation/Plugins/SharpTvNetworkRemote/SharpTvNetworkRemote.zip.

This update is very minor which addresses an issue of the plugin failing to load if it has been renamed before installation into Indigo.

This email was sent to you because the update checker was enabled; only one email will be sent for this version update. If you wish to stop receiving update notifications, you may turn off the feature from the Sharp TV Network Remote's configuration screen found via the Plugins menu within Indigo. If you have any problems or need assistance with the plugin, please visit the forum at http://www.perceptiveautomation.com/userforum/viewforum.php?f=64.

Thanks!
