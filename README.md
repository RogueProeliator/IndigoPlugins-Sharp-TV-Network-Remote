# Introduction
This plugin allows Indigo to control Sharp AQUOS televisions via their network (IP) control protocol. Sharp's protocol is very robust and, as a result, this plugin is able to both read and set nearly every aspect of the television - from volume/channel through configurations such as picture mode, aspect ratio, etc.
